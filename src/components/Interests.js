        <p>I love learning, and in my free time I love to read books on History & Historical Fiction, Finance, and Personal Development. I'm also a musician, and play the guitar & piano. I even built a website sharing some lessons I created to help people learn the guitar, which you can find here:   <a href="teamsdamusic.tech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">teamsdamusic.tech</a></p>
